# SERVER server
A video-game about managing the server and players of a famous MMORPG game

# Tools

- Unreal Engine 5.4.1
- git LFS (with file-locking)
- Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code

# Narrative

With no typical MMORPG server infrastructure at hand, the unnamed, unidentified player character manually tends to the needs of MMORPG players.

## Tone

- Gameplay should blend goofiness and a gradually increasing sense of stress
- Narrative should be dystopian and dreadful (?)

## Context

Who is the player character taking care of the server?
- What are their motivations

What is the game whose server we are taking care of?
- Who is playing our game?
- How long has it existed, and what is its reputation?
- Why should we care about it?

Why are we taking care of the server?
- if working for a corporation, what is it called?
    - who runs the corporation?
    - who works there?
    - what are the corporation's values and motivations?

# Gameplay

The player will manipulate a computer cursor, using it to pick up, move, and interact with physics-based tools and objects scattered across various stations in order to satisfy player needs.

## Game Loop

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Before we define the gameloop, we need to better establish the narrative, which will in turn inform the win and lose conditions of the game.
